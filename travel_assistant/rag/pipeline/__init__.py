"""
RAG Pipeline Components.

This module contains the core components of the RAG pipeline:

- RetrieverService: Handles document retrieval from vector database
- ContextBuilder: Processes and structures retrieved context
- RAGGenerationService: Generates final responses using LLM

These components work together to implement the complete RAG workflow:
Query → Retrieval → Context Processing → Generation → Response
